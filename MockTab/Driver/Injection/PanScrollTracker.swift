/// began/changed/ended lifecycle. That phase-free shape is deliberate: a real
/// trackpad pairs its phased deltas with a companion gesture-event stream that
/// the public CGEvent API cannot forge, and recognizers that key on the phase
/// lifecycle (Calendar Month/Year, WebKit gesture-scroll / overscroll-behavior,
/// Adobe palettes) reject a phased stream that lacks that gesture backing.
/// Captured third-party scroll tools that pan those apps smoothly (Smooze)
/// emit exactly this phase-free continuous shape.

/// A short-window release velocity is still maintained here regardless (it is
